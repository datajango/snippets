- created branch git

    ```
    git checkout -b git
    ```

- added a python .gitignore from https://github.com/github/gitignore
    - this looks like a great repo with a huge commity collection of .gitignore files.

- I compared the Python .gitignore from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python to the https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore and they look very similiar.

- I question the value of my snippets repo and if it is maintainable or sustainable.  The fact that the https://github.com/github/gitignore repo exists give me a little pause.

- What do I hope to achieve?

    1. Store snippets as well as complete files.
    1. Store differnt types of snippets, not just for gitignore.
    1. Use curl, wget and git clone to extract single files or entire folders.
    1. Use this repo as a way to get organized and collect code snippets with instructions on how to use them.
