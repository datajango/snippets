## Why?

Ever want to reuse a file from one project to another? I certainly do.  I find myself reusing the same .gitignore and ini templates over and over again.

## How to use this repo

1. To grab a single file using curl

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datajango/snippets/main/git/python.gitignore > .gitignore
    ```
